## On Trimming Tensor-structured Measurements and Efficient Low-rank Tensor Recovery

This repository contains the code for our experiments and plots for our paper - [On Trimming Tensor-structured Measurements and Efficient Low-rank Tensor Recovery](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.02843)

## Organization:

* The files [Adaptive_removal_functions.py](https://github.com/shambhavi-suri/Low-Rank-Tensor-Recovery/tree/main/large_tensor_experiments) and [KZTIHT_functions.py](https://github.com/shambhavi-suri/Low-Rank-Tensor-Recovery/tree/main/large_tensor_experiments) have the code for the TrimTIHT and KaczTIHT algorithms respectively.
